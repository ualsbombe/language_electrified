## Installation
1) Go to the folder where you want to keep the analysis-related filed (scripts, figures and data)
2) Download and run _create\_paths.sh_
3) Download the scripts folders into _language\_EEG_ and _language\_MEG_ respectively
4) Get the data for subject subj2 (EEG) __needs a DOI___ and put in in the data folder of _language\_EEG_
5) Get the data for subject _sub-V1002_ from http://hdl.handle.net/11633/di.dccn.DSC_3011020.09_236 and put it in the data folder of _language\_MEG_
6) Start running the scripts for the analyses (all called _single\_subject\_analysis_, ending on _.sh_, _.py_ and _.m_
